<h3>A mattle black will add modern, sophisticated element to your home. Its simplicity allows
it to step back and grant other features in your room the opportunity to stand out. A piece with
a mattle finish gives a nice contrast against glossy surfaces and metallic accents.</h3>

<h2>Tan/Camel</h2>

compliments any space and just gives an overall Fall vibe.</h3>

<h2>Chic Plaid</h2>

<h3>Plaid is perfect for a variety of looks you may be going for, from vintage country
to modern farmhouse. This is a versatile pattern that can be incorporated by including
a plaid rug or accent pillow. A nice blanket with this pattern would work perfect for the
cozy look mentioned in 'Cozy Textiles'.</h3>
